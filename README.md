# Maparea
A data mapping component.

## What is it?
Maparea is a simple PHP component which maps a data structure to a mapped data structure.

## In what case do I need this?
At Enrise we were challenged by replacing an existing external API with a new one.

However the output should be backwards compatible, so we used this component to map the new API to the old structure.
